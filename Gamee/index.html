	<h1>Welcome to the BlackJack Game&#128512;</h1>
	<h2>Rules for the Game</h2>
    <br>In this game you will be play with a robot and asked if you would like to draw another card.</br>
    <br>The computer will then pick a random number between 1 and 10 for you and display them in an alert.</br>
    <br>If the total of your cards is over 21 you automatically lose that round.</br>
    <br>If you have 21 or less, the robot always draws 3 cards (also between 1 and 10). </br>
    <br>If the computer goes over 21 you win, if you both have the same total you draw, </br>
	<br>if the computer is higher than you (but less than or equal to 21) it wins, and if the computer is lower than you, you win.</br>
